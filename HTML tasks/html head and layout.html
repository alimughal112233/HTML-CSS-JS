        Karachi, city and capital of Sindh province, southern Pakistan. 
        It is the country’s largest city and principal seaport and is a major commercial and industrial centre. 
        Karachi is located on the coast of the Arabian Sea immediately northwest of the Indus River delta.
        The city has been variously called Caranjee, Crochey, Krotchey, Currachee, and Kurrachee, all of which are believed to be variants of the same name. 
        In the 18th century it was known as Kalachi-jo-Goth,meaning “the village of Kalachi” (Kalachi being the name of an erstwhile head of the settlement).
